- A confirmation alert notifies the user that the quote has been successfully copied.

### **Responsive Design**
- The layout is styled using CSS Flexbox to ensure the quote box is centered both vertically and horizontally.
- Media queries adjust the font sizes and button styles for smaller screens.
